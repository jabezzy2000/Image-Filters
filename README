This is a project which seeks to edit image using image_io.py, a Utility class to help users read/write image files to a
directory. This was modified by Alex Krentsel for Fall 2021's iteration of CSCI100 at Howard University.

Given a picture, this code will convert it into a 3d list, edit the pixel value according to the preferred filter option, return an edited matrix and
then converts the matrix back into an image using PIL, or more precisely, image_io.py written/edited by Prof. Alex Krentsel
